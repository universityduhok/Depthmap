‪Hello, I’m Architect Wafaa ‬
‪I have a question, I analysed this settlement below by using Depthmap software program and when I reduce all fewest line map (minimal) in comparison with fewest line map (subsets) I found there is a different analysis in the integrated axial lines( completely differen as shown below)‬

‪If anyone has an explanation I’ll appreciate it‬
